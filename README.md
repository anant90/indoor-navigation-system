Indoor Navigation System for Visually Impaired

The project consists of the following parts. The documentation for each part can be found in individual directories.

1. A Java project that converts a .kml document containing placemarks and lines encoded in Keyhole Markup to our own lightweight format for representing navigable areas in a building.
2. An app written using PyS60 (Python for Symbian 60) framework that serves as the mobile client for cheap Nokia phones that a visually impaired person can use to navigate in a building.
3. I'm trying to find code writtten for the bluetooth module running on Arduino microcontroller.
